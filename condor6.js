var content = "A captive breeding program for California condors was launched. It was slow to start, but steadily increased when biologists utilized the birdsâ€™ ability to double clutch, or produce a second egg if the first is lost. They removed the first egg, built highly realistic condor-head puppets, and raised the separated chicks with puppets. The number of condors grew, and in 1991 the breeding programs began to release California Condors back into their native territory.";
